# My Capabilities & How I Can Help

## ✅ What I CAN Do:

### React Frontend Development
- Build beautiful React PWAs with Tailwind CSS
- Create booking interfaces, dashboards, admin panels
- Integrate with APIs (Stripe, Airtable, Cal.com, Daily.co)
- Build payment UIs that connect to your Stripe setup
- Create member/host portals with real-time data

### Backend (Supabase Only)
- Create Supabase edge functions
- Set up database tables and queries
- Handle authentication and storage

## ❌ What I CANNOT Do:

### Third-Party Service Configuration
- Configure Stripe webhooks in your dashboard
- Build or debug Zapier workflows
- Set up Airtable automations
- Access your Cal.com/Daily.co/Twilio accounts
- Trigger test payments in Stripe

## 🤔 For Your Presence Build:

**Your Issue:** Stripe webhooks not firing test events

**I Can't Fix:** The Stripe/Zapier/Airtable connection directly

**I CAN Build:** The React PWA frontend that:
- Shows host profiles and availability
- Displays booking calendar
- Processes payments via Stripe Checkout
- Shows member dashboard with session history
- Integrates with your Airtable data

**What I Need From You:**
Tell me if you want the React frontend built, or if you need help with the backend integrations (which requires a different specialist).
